# CS103a Express App Demo

This is a starter project which has a simple authentication module 
and provides access to a mongoose database in the cloud.

## Installation
Download the project from github and download nodejs and npm from https://nodejs.org
and cd into the folder

Install the packages with
``` bash
npm install
```
Start the project with
``` bash
node app.js
```
You can also start the project using
``` bash

```
or run it in your code editor of choice,

or even install nodemon (the node monitoring app) with
